    <h1> Rules To Follow <h1>
      <p>1) Be NICE to your SIBLINGS and YOURSELF! (This means using Proper Pronouns!)

             -Keep in mind, some siblings have alts and may not remember conversations. Intense emotions can bring out certain alts.

2) EVERYONE has to do a DAILY check-ins! (How much water have you had? Have you ate anything? If you have medication, have you taken them?)

3) If you need to talk to an ADULT SIBLINGS or MOM, all you have to do is @ one of us! (Don't spam us please. If we don't respond within 5 minutes, try another one of us.) However, if it is an emergency, make sure you are friends with Mom and your Adult Siblings so you can call us.

4) Do NOT go into the Therapy Room unless an Adult Sibling Or Mom move you there, or ask you to go in there. 

5) If you have an issue with someone/topic and you ask them to stop/discontinue multiple times but they don't, bring it up with Mom or an Adult Sibling.

6) Ask Mom or an Adult sibling to add another sibling to your room if you want/need them.

7) WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BATHROOM STAYS IN THE BATHROOM!
